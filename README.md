# -UVM-Verification-of-ALU-Design
The main aim of this project is to go through the complete verification flow to generate a 
working UVM testbench for a simple IP using the UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) 
Framework. 
Project Requirements:  
In this project, it is required to build a complete UVM and SystemVerilog testbench using 
Synopsys tools for the open-source ALU design available at: https://shorturl.at/lvwX6 through the 
following steps: 
1. Verification plan 
— The design specification and testbench architecture. 
— Design under test (DUT) interface with the testbench. 
— The testing scenarios and Coverpoints in functional coverage. 
2. SystemVerilog code for the UVM Testbench with constrained random stimulus generation. 
3. Functional coverage analysis. 
4. Code coverage reporting. 
5. Simulation results for different testing scenarios.
